Thanks for cancelation order but I want to make it again clear. When you come to me, we start talking I cleared mentioned that whole cost will be $900 but you said still we can work on 2 pages. Always price depend on number of functionality Fiver does not have more then 6-7 pages so you think someone can make under $100.  When you read my gigs details why you skip that line which I already mentioned in bold that you must first talk in messages then will give you quotes.  If you find about pa_pment gateway, then you will find developer only take more then $500 just to implement one pa_yment gateway.  In that small amount only simple pages with only navigation pages attached. Anyway it does not affect me to cancel that order but it will effect my other orders
